@complexity

O(N) where N is the total number of elements in all given sets.

This command is equal to `SUNION`, but instead of returning the resulting set,
it is stored in `destination`.

If `destination` already exists, it is overwritten.

@return

@integer-reply: the number of elements in the resulting set.
