Redis Sponsors
===

All the work [Salvatore Sanfilippo](http://twitter.com/antirez) and [Pieter Noordhuis](http://twitter.com/pnoordhuis) are doing in order to develop Redis is sponsored by [VMware](http://vmware.com). The Redis project no longer accepts money donations.

In the past Redis accepted donations from the following companies:

* [Linode](http://linode.com) 15 January 2010, provided Virtual Machines for Redis testing in a virtualized environment.
* [Slicehost](http://slicehost.com) 14 January 2010, provided Virtual Machines for Redis testing in a virtualized environment.
* [Citrusbyte](http://citrusbyte.com) 18 Dec 2009, part of Virtual Memory. Citrusbyte is also the company developing the Redis-rb bindings for Redis and this very web site.
* [Hitmeister](http://www.hitmeister.de/) 15 Dec 2009, part of Redis Cluster.
* [Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com) 13 Dec 2009, for blocking POP (BLPOP) and part of the Virtual Memory implementation.

Also thanks to the following people or organizations that donated to the Project:

* Emil Vladev

We are grateful to [VMware](http://vmware.com) and to the companies and people that donated to the Redis project. Thank you.
