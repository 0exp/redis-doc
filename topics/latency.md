Redis latency problems troubleshooting
===

This document will help you understanding what the problem could be if you
are experiencing latency problems with Redis.

In this context *latency* is the maximum delay between the time a client
issues a command and the time the reply to the command is received by the
client. Usually the Redis latency is extremely low, in the sub microsecond
range, but there are certain conditions leading to higher latency figures.

Single threaded nature of Redis
-------------------------------

Redis uses a *mostly* single threaded design. This means that a single process
serves all the client requests, using a technique called **multiplexing**.
This means that Redis can serve a single request in every given moment, so
all the requests are served sequentially. This is very similar to how node.js
works as well. However you usually don't feel at all Redis or Node are slow
since the time to serve a single request is very small, and this kind of
programs are designed to don't block on system calls, for instance to read
new data from sockets.

I said that Redis is *mostly* single threaded since actually from Redis 2.4
we use threads in Redis in order to perform some slow I/O operations in the
background, mainly related to disk I/O, but this does not change the fact
that Redis servers all the requests using a single thread.

Latency generated by slow commands
----------------------------------

A consequence of being single thread is that when a request is slow to serve
all the other clients will wait for this request to be served. When executing
normal commands, like **GET** or **SET** or **LPUSH** this is not a problem
at all since this commands are executed in constant (and very small) time.
However there are commands operating on many elements, like **SORT**, **LREM**, **SUNION** and others. For instance taking the intersection of two big sets
can take a considerable amount of time.

If you have latency concerns you should either not use slow commands against
values composed of many elements, or you should run a replica using Redis
replication where to run all your slow queries.

It is possible to monitor slow commands using the Redis [Slow Log feature](/commands/slowlog).

Latency generated by fork

Latency due to AOF and disk I/O
-------------------------------

Another source of latency is due to the Append Only File support on Redis.
The AOF basically uses two system calls to accomplish its work. One is
write(2) that is used in order to write data to the append only file, and
the other one is fdatasync(2) that is used in order to flush the kernel
file buffer on disk in order to ensure the durability level specified by
the user.

Both the write(2) and fdatasync(2) calls can be source of latency.
For instance write(2) can block both when there is a system wide sync
in progress, or when the output buffers are full and the kernel requires
to flush on disk in order to accept new writes.

The fdatasync(2) call is a worse source of latency as with many combinations
of kernels and file systems used it can take from a few milliseconds to
a few seconds to complete, especially in the case of some other process
doing I/O. For this reason when possible Redis does the fdatasync(2) call
in a different thread since Redis 2.4.

We'll see how configuration can affect the amount and source of latency
when using the AOF file.

The AOF can be configured to perform an fsync on disk in three different
ways using the **appendfsync** configuration option (this setting can be
modified at runtime using the **CONFIG SET** command).

* When appendfsync is set to the value of **no** Redis performs no fsync.
In this configuration the only source of latency can be write(2).
When this happens usually there is no solution since simply the disk can't
cope with the speed at which Redis is receiving data, however this is
uncommon if the disk is not seriously slowed down by other processes doing
I/O.

* When appendfsync is set to the value of **everysec** Redis performs an
fsync every second. It uses a different thread, and if the fsync is still
in progress Redis uses a buffer to delay the write(2) call up to two seconds
(since write would block on Linux if an fsync is in progress against the
same file). However if the fsync is taking too long Redis will eventually
perform the write(2) call even if the fsync is still in progress, and this
can be a source of latency.

* When appendfsync is set to the value of **always** an fsync is performed
at every write operation before replying back to the client with an OK code
(actually Redis will try to cluster many commands executed at the same time
into a single fsync). In this mode performances are very low in general and
it is strongly recommended to use a fast disk and a file system implementation
that can perform the fsync in short time.

Most Redis users will use either the **no** or **everysec** setting for the
appendfsync configuration directive. The suggestion for minimum latency is
to avoid other processes doing I/O in the same system.
Using an SSD disk can help as well, but usually even non SSD disks perform
well with the append only file if the disk is spare as Redis writes
to the append only file without performing any seek.

If you want to investigate your latency issues related to the append only
file you can use the strace command under Linux:

    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync

The above command will show all the fdatasync(2) system calls performed by
Redis in the main thread. With the above command you'll not see the
fdatasync system calls performed by the background thread when the
the appendfsync config option is set to **everysec**. In order to do so
just add the -f switch to strace.

If you wish you can also see both fdatasync and write system calls with the
following command:

    sudo strace -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write

However since write(2) is also used in order to write data to the client
sockets this will likely show too many things unrelated to disk I/O.
Apparently there is no way to tell strace to just show slow system calls so
I use the following command:

    sudo strace -f -p $(pidof redis-server) -T -e trace=fdatasync,write 2>&1 | grep -v '0.0' | grep -v unfinished
